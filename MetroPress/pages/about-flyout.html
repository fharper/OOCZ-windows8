                    <p>Out of Comfort Zone is the personal and professional blog of Fred. He used this blog to talk about any day-to-day subject, but also to publish blog posts he did on other websites. You will be able to read topics in English or in French around three main areas: brainer, no-brainer and techno. The techno category contains everything technical or related to the developers’ world. If a blog post is not around IT stuff, and it’s a blog post with some reflexion around society, life or anything else, you will be able to read it in the brainer category. The last, but not least category is for everything that required to brain power to digest: pictures I want to share, funny things that happened to me. It’s the kind of things you usually share on Twitter in less than 140 characters. I hope you will have as much fun to read all my blog posts than I had fun to write them.</p>
